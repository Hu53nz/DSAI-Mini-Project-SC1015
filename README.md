Predicting Life Expectancy with Machine Learning

By: Husen, Rohit, KW Pong

Our Project:

What is the most critical factor in determining one's life expectancy?

Our Motivations:

Global life expectancy at birth has increased significantly from an average of 31 to 72 
(1900 -> 2016) Life expectancy is influenced by a range of factors But out of these 

factors, which is the most important?

Exploratory Data Analysis:

• Sort and removing of values.

• Combining of two data sets

• Correlation Matrix to find the best 3 factors that affect life expectancy.

Given the multifaceted nature of the present day socio-economic and environmental 
landscape, there exist a multitude of factors that affect life expectancy. To have a better 
prediction, we adopted an approach to narrow down three key factors that we believe 
would have the most significant impact on life expectancy.

Machine Learning Technique:

Linear Regression:

• Usage of Stats model Package

• Finding Residual Graph

• Comparing Similarities of Error Terms

• Finding Best Fit Line to Find Relations

Classification Tree:

• Use Discretization to Convert Continuous Variable to Categorical Variable

• Convert 1D Array Predictor to 2D Array

• Calculation of a 4 x 4 Confusion Matrics

The primary objective of conducting two distinct machine learning techniques was to 
evaluate and compare the efficacy of it. To accomplish this, we performed 
comprehensive analysis of the resulting data in order to identify any potential 
differences or similarities between the two method, with the ultimate aim of gaining 
deeper insight into their respective capabilities and limitations.

Conclusion:

• Linear Regression is the best for continuous variables.

• Logged GDP per Capita is the more important factor in predicting life expectancy.

• Its recommended to pay more attention on Logged GDP per Capita to ensure a
better chance of living a long life.

• Discretization is not a fullproof way to ensure accuracy.
